The tools of the trade.

I'll preface this by saying I am not a tool snob. If someone is going to write (or act, or sing, or make music, etc.) they are going to write (act, sing, make music) come hell or high water. But there does come a point where you have your process and you like the way you do things and you think that helps you   
so yeah, here's mine.

I write by hand 95% of the time. I like these writing instruments.
